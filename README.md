The project aims to generate a time series forecast for a set of stocks using 
various forecasting models like the Arima model, HoltÂ­Winters model and linear regression. 
Specifically the R programming language (popular for its use in statistical analysis) is used to 
analyse a dataset containing stock data and identify the stocks with the minimum MAE(Mean 
Absolute Error) which is a common metric for evaluating errors in time series analysis using 
the different models. Finally graphs are plotted of the 10 minimum MAE stocks in each of the 
models.
